Our test suite will run our Google Maps API that gets the distance between the current location and the nearest locations. 
Additionally, the test suite will refactor the code to make it easier for the graph building/data storage.
We will manually get the distance from the current Taco Bell to the three nearest Taco Bells using Google Maps.
We will then compare that distance to what was distance calculated using the API and our CSV parsing.
